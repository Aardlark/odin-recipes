        <h2>Rancho Gordo Magical Black Beans</h2>

        <p>These might be the most surprising, yet simple black beans I
            have ever laid my hands on. If you didn't know,
            dried black beans lend themselves to a much firmer texture that is
            <strong>packed</strong> with flavor. Cook the beans with a simple 
        mirepoix and you'll be glad you did. The best part - you don't even need to soak them! </p>
        <p>I stumbled on <a href="https://www.ranchogordo.com/">Rancho Gordo</a>
            at a local grocery store in the Fishtown section of Philadelphia called
             <a href="https://www.riverwardsproduce.com/">Riverwards Produce</a>. This recipe is adapted
                 directly from Rancho Gordo and I'll never make them another way.

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup onions</li>
            <li>1/2 cup celery</li>
            <li>1/2 cup carrots</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 cup of dried black beans</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li><em>optional:</em> flavored stock</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Check beans for any debris and rinse well.</li>
            <li>Heat saute pan with olive oil over medium-heat and saute onions, celery, carrots, and garlic.</li>
            <li>Once vegetables are soft, add dried beans and enough water [<em>or stock</em>] to cover beans by about 2 inches.</li>
            <li>Bring the pot to a rapid boil for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reduce head to a gentle simmer and cook, uncovered for 1 to 3 hours. <em>If the bean-cooking water starts to get low, add <strong>hot</strong> water directly from a kettle.</em></li>
            <li>Salt the beans once they are just starting to turn soft.</li>
        </ol>
