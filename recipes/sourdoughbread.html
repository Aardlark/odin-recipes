        <h2>Sourdough Bread</h2>

        <p>Were we all part of the Sourdough COVID craze? I learned to bake sourdough with thousands of other bakers across the country as COVID-19 sprawled throughout the world. It took many weeks to nail down the perfect loaf, but I am convinced that these ratios and techniques will produce a beautiful loaf.</p>
        <p>This recipe was adapted from Tartine's Country Bread recipe. I worked to add slightly more whole wheat bread flour to make the loaf more nutrient-rich, so feel free to adjust as necessary while keeping the total flour amount at 1000g. You'll find that you need slightly more hydration as you take away more of the white bread flour. <strong>Practice makes perfect!</strong></p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>200g Sourdough Starter</li>
            <li>800g White Bread Flour</li>
            <li>200g Whole Wheat Bread Flour</li>
            <li>800g Water</li>
            <li>20g Salt</li>
          
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>

            <li>In a bowl, combine 200g sourdough starter with 725g of warm water. Use your hands to completely mix it up. Store remaining sourdough starter in fridge.</li>
            <li>Add 800g white bread flour and 200g whole wheat bread flour to the bowl. Use hands to squish dough and combine until it's a shaggy and sticky dough. Cover bowl with a towel or plastic wrap and let the dough rest for 30 to 45 minutes at room temperatre.</li>
            <li>Dissolve 20 grams salt and 75g warm water in a separate container. Pour mixture into dough and use hands to incorporate thourghout. </li>
            <li>Once dough comes together, proceed with the slap-and-fold method for around 4 minutes. <em>NOTE</em>: see below for a great example of the slap-and-fold method.</li>
            <li>Cover dough with a towel and let sit for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>After 30 minutes, begin the series of 4 stretch-and-folds. Using wet hands, grab one side of the dough and fold it onto itself. Rotate bowl 90 degrees, grab dough and fold it into itself. Continue this process until you rotate the bowl a complete 360 degrees. Let rest for 30-45 minutes. </li>
            <li>Repeat stretch-and-fold technique at least 3 more times, with 30-45 minutes in between each. Once ready, the dough should look slightly rounded and jiggle when you shake the bowl gently. </li>
            <li>If dough does not look like it rose 25-30%, let sit an additional hour in a warm environment.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and dust top with white bread flour. Cut dough into 2 equal pieces and flip.</li>
            <li>Stretch cut-side of dough to form a crust with the remaining flour on surface. Work dough into taut rounds and rest, covered, for 30 minutes</li>
            <li>Using a 1:1 whole-wheat bread flour and rice flour mixter, dust proofing baskets</li>
            <li>Flip rounds so floured sides are facing down. Now it's time to shape the dough. Pull the bottom two corners of the dough toward you and fold them up into the middle third of the dough. Repeat this action on the right and left side. Lastly, lift the top corners and fold down over previous folds</li>
            <li>Roll dough over so the folded side becomes the bottom. Use a bench scraper to shape dough into a smooth, taught ball.</li>
            <li>Transfer loafs, seam-side up, to proofing baskets. Cover and put in refrigerator overnight or for at least 10-12 hours.</li>
            <li>On the next day, preheat oven to 500 degrees with a dutch oven inside.</li>
            <li>Flip proofing baskets over a sheet of parchment paper and place loaf directly into preheated dutch oven, covered. <em>NOTE: My dutch oven only has the capacity to fit one loaf. Wait to flip out the 2nd loaf until you take the 1st out of the oven</em></li>
            <li>After 20 minutes, remove lid and cook for an additional 20 minutes, or until crust looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough to wire rack and let cool for at least 20 minutes. The more you can wait, the better the loaf will be.</li>
            <li>Repeat with final loaf.</li>
